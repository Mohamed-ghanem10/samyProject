This project applies Object-Oriented Programming concepts using Python by simulating a real-life scenario involving employees, offices, and cars.

âœ… Implemented Classes:
Person

Attributes: name, money, mood, healthRate

Methods:

sleep(hours) â€“ sets mood based on sleep hours

eat(meals) â€“ sets health rate

buy(items) â€“ reduces money per item

Employee (inherits from Person)

Attributes: id, car, email, salary, distanceToWork

Methods:

work(hours) â€“ sets mood based on work hours

drive(distance) â€“ initiates car run

refuel(gasAmount) â€“ refuels the car

send_mail() â€“ (not fully detailed)

Car

Attributes: name, fuelRate, velocity

Methods:

run(velocity, distance) â€“ reduces fuel, changes speed

stop() â€“ sets velocity to 0 and prints status

Constraints:

Velocity: 0â€“200

Fuel rate: 0â€“100

Office

Attributes: name, employees

Methods:

hire(), fire(), get_employee(), get_all_employees()

deduct(), reward()

check_lateness(), calculate_lateness() (static)

Class variable: employeesNum

Class method: change_emps_num(num)

ðŸ›  Scenario Overview:
Samy is an employee at ITI.

He drives 20 km daily to work with a Fiat 128.

He must arrive before 9:00 AM.

Fuel decreases by 10% every 10 km.

"A GUI was added for some inputs using the Tkinter library, and the required task was executed."
